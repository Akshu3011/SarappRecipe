# sarApp 
## Welcome to a more delicious world!

## Description

### Our project was inspired by the lack of representation in mainstream media and society of foods from different parts of the world. We wanted to create a project that would shine a light on cultures from around the world and show their delicious cuisines. We want to introduce users to a new palate consisting of new cultures, ingredients, and methods of cooking and eating. Food is what brings people together and what better way to merge tech and food than creating a community of food-lovers from around the world that can share the foods and recipes that they love in a fun and interactive way! Our project-sarApp-is a recipe sharing app for food lovers of the world!

## Usage

### Simply visit the deployed website here https://sarapprecipes.herokuapp.com/ to start! Users will be taken to a website that prompts for their login information or prompts them to sign up. Afterwards, Users will be taken to a homepage where they can view a snippet of recipes from around the world on the homepage. They can scroll down to see delicious recipes from our curated AND user-generated library. Users can then navigate to their own profile to create their own recipes and upload them to the website. They will also be given the option to upload an image to really entice other users to try their recipes! 

## Features

### Features include:
### Login/Logout/Sign-up functionality
### Submitting User Input (via uploading recipes)
### Uploading images 
### Filtering recipes by region and dietary accommodations tags

## Technologies 

### GitHub was used to clone a new repository onto a computer. Visual Studio Code was used to create and MVC and to create files such as JS, SQL, and handlebar files. GitBash Terminal was used to git add/commit/push edits made from the local repository into GitHub to update the repository.

## Installation

### Tools needed are GitHub to name and clone the repository into a local computer/repository. GitBash Terminal should be installed and one can clone repository with either an SSH key or the HTML URL and with the command-”git clone”-and copying in the URL or SSH key, upload to Terminal-making sure they are not within another folder but in the main branch-and using the commands git add . (press enter) then git commit -m "detailed description of your edits" (press enter) then git push (press enter) and entering their SSH key if prompted. 

### A new folder should be created and once Visual Studio Code is installed, open the new folder in VS and make new JS, SQL, and handlebar files. Run the following commands to install required packages; npm i sequelize, npm i express, npm i bcrypt, npm i connect-session-sequelize, npm i dotenv, npm i express-handlebars, npm i express-session and npm i mysql2 package from the mysql docs and once installed, run the command mysql -u root -p and enter your password once prompted. Afterward, in the terminal where mysql is loaded, initialize the database by running SOURCE db/schema.sql and then you can exit and return to the server.js where you can run node "name of your file".js to view data. Once all is installed, view all changes and progress made in the "Open Terminal" when you right click on the JS file and run node.

### GitBash Terminal is once again needed to upload edits made in your local repository into GitHub-using the same commands of git add ./git commit -m/git push in order for the changes to be displayed and final push to be on heroku.
### Heroku was used to do a final deployment.
